# üê• Ducklang

*No PhD required!*

## ü¶Ü About

Ducklang is a duck-typed programming language with an emphasis on readability of the language.

### Principles

* **Duck typing**: Testing over typing - a good type system can get complex, while a good integration suite can give peace of mind
* **Encapsulation**: The language is completely object oriented, with all state held in objects
* **Composition**: (over inheritance) - the quick wins of inheritance can lead to code structures that are hard to refactor
* **Inversion of control**: Dependencies inject into modules, not the other way round
* **Readability**: (over concision) - the code we tend to be most proud of is code that can be read almost like prose
* **Promises**: Asynchronicity using promises and processes like JavaScript, however the `async`/`await` behaviour is inverted - everything is `await`'ed unless the `background` keyword is used
* **Smart tabs**: Indentation-aware syntax like Python - tabs for indentation, and spaces for alignment
* **Named arguments**: methods calls pass arguments by name, for readability and ease of code evolution
* **Extensibility**: most operators expand into method calls, so you aren't tied by what comes shipped with the language
* **Separation of Concerns**: all code is stand-alone and can be "mixed-in" with existing types, allowing for smaller modules which do one thing and do it well
* **Uniformity**: emphasis on the object oriented paradigm, and uniform whitespace make "other people's code" nicer to see!

### Code examples

Please see the [fixtures](fixtures/) directory for example code

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Install
```shell script
yarn
```

### Run
```shell script
yarn build && yarn parse <fixtures/getOrDefault.dg
yarn build && yarn parse <fixtures/run.dg
yarn build && yarn parse <fixtures/program.dg
yarn build && yarn parse <fixtures/rocket.dg
```

## Roadmap

* Clean up the Nearley output using functions
* Build a representation of the program from the parse tree
